## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
I used this project to improve my SCSS and responsive navbar skills. 
I made sure the website is fully responsive.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .header-img{
		position: relative;
		top: 10rem;


		img{
			width: 90%;
		}
	}
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  navLink.forEach (n => n.addEventListener('click' , closeMenu))
}
```


### Continued development

I'm focusing on perfecting my SCSS skills
